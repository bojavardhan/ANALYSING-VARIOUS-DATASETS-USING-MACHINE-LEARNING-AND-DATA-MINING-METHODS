# ANALYSING-VARIOUS-DATASETS-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING-AND-DATA-MINING-METHODS
Data Mining is the cooperation of     quantitative methods helps in extracting the actionable information from data resources. This paper explains the process of three different types of datasets i.e. Road accident based, the other is New York City Airbnb and final one is House sales prediction. We use evaluation methods to find accuracy of models and mining technologies for predictions. This paper the gives the information on various data mining techniques like Decision tree, Random Forest, KNN, Multilinear regression, Logistic Regression. The classification or regression model performance is completely depending on the data we selected. For better understanding of all the proceedings we applied Knowledge discovery in database (KDD) which includes cleaning, incorporation and transformation of data and then summon best fit model.

#Dataset 

Logistic Regression and  KNN are the best suitable and most evaluated data mining techniques to bring the best predictions for US Accidents dataset. Using these methodologies, we are identifying the factors influencing fatal car accidents

Second dataset is based on House price prediction. we are using [18] multiple regression for finding the major key factors effecting the cost of houses.

The third and final dataset is based on an online based marketing company “New York Airbnb” who wants to understand the customers behavior on selecting the room based on different factors. we are performing random forest and decision tree based on few instances which have most effect on predicting.
